  `Genuine laughter disables, even if only momentarily, the less beneficial emotions, that can otherwise surface.`,
  `Gridlock is a complete lack of movement or progress resulting in stagnation. When we avoid uncomfortable truths and remain fixed in our comfort zones we stop moving forward.`,
  `Reflection is the key to self-awareness, to identifying our strengths. We do not learn from experience alone, but by reflecting on that experience.`,

  `The past is in your head. The future is in your hands.`,

  `Do you over worry and blow problems out of proportion? Dwelling on negative events or worrying about what might happen in the future is limiting behaviour. When we get into this "vicious cycle" of thinking, it is hard to think realistically and remember all the good and positive things in our lives. Tell your mind to shut up!`,
  `It can be helpful to think of feeling lonely like feeling hungry. Just as your body uses hunger to tell your body you need food, loneliness is a way of your body telling you that you need more social contact. That means the simplest way to ease feelings of loneliness can be to try to meet more, or different, people.`,
  `Our age should not define us. As the oldest person to board a U.S. Space Shuttle at age 77, Senator John Glenn exemplified this view.

  `The notion of innocence refers to children's simplicity, their lack of knowledge, and their purity not yet spoiled by mundane affairs. There is a child in all of us, who yearns for the simple things in life food, shelter, love and security. Are you in touch with your inner child?`,
  `Look on the bright side. Be a glass half full kind of person and try to turn the negatives in your life to positives. But how do I this when life is dark, you say. And we reply, look around you and open your heart to the beauty that you’re ignoring in your self-absorbed state. Thumbs up to life.`,
  `Companionship is that state of being friends, but it goes deeper than even a friendship. It is a closeness or familiarity, a true fellowship among two people who for whatever reasons have truly connected.`,
  `Stress, anxiety and depression are caused when we are living to please others – Paulo Coelho`,
  `When our heart is open we can illuminate the darkest of places, increase our vitality, emotional balance and meet life head on. When our heart is open, we are better communicators and more compassionate. Open up!`,
  `Life is all about how we see things.`,
  `Freedom stands for something greater than just the right to act however we choose—it also stands for securing equal opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.`,
  `Life without love is meaningless. It has no depth, no attraction, no warmth. Even if you have nobody to love and nobody to love you, it’s there - in a baby’s laugh, a stranger’s kind words and the beauty of nature. Feel the love`,
  `What makes you happy – hanging out with friends, visiting the countryside, getting a good night’s sleep, spending time with a pet? Whatever it is, make a list and prioritise those things.`,
  `To 'turn over a new leaf' means to start over, to act in a different manner or change your attitude about something. We often get stuck in old habits. Do you feel ready to turn over a new leaf and work on self-improvement?`,

  `A semicolon is used when an author could've chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to. The author is you and the sentence is your life.`,
  `What is the meaning of the butterfly? This animal totem is associated with symbolism of change and transformation, renewal and rebirth. A secondary meaning of the butterfly is about finding joy in life and lightness of being. Have you found the joy in your life? Like the butterfly, it’s there fleetingly, but if you’re not looking out for it, you may miss it.`,
  `When all around you seems dark and grey, reach out to the light of your own survival instinct. We humans are resilient if we put our minds to fighting what ails us. We all have the power to change within us. Be like a sunflower and follow the light.`,
  `Smiling makes us attractive to others. There is an automatic attraction to people who smile.`,
  `Smiling changes mood. If you try, even when it’s difficult, when you’re not in a good place, there is a chance it might change the way you’re feeling.`,
  `Smiling is contagious. Others will want to be with you and you will be helping others feel good.`,
  `Feeling anxiety? Do a "grounding" tool. Look around you. Find 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This is caused "grounding". It’s helpful to do whenever you feel anxious.`,
  `The companionship that a pet offers is a great way to reduce anxiety and stress. In many ways, pets can help us to live mentally healthier lives. Dogs especially are great at encouraging owners to get exercise, and this can be beneficial for those suffering from depression.`,
  `Are you feeling overwhelmed by all that life is throwing at you? Should you be taking time out to relax and take stock? Your mental wellbeing is precious and needs nurturing. Don’t wait until you’re running on empty beat the stress.`,
  `Be a light for those who have lost the will to burn.`,
  `Many friends will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends stay the course. What does it take to be a good friend? Time, presence, effort and loyalty. Reach out to your clan today!`,
  `We all need laughter in our lives.`,
  `All you need is LOL.`,
  `Wouldn’t it be great to be a chameleon, to be able to transform ourselves with little effort. Change can be hard. It requires no effort to settle for the same old thing. But transforming your life requires courage, commitment and effort. But to get to the really good stuff in life, you have to be willing to get out of your comfort zone and take a chance. Be a chameleon today!`,
  `What’s your purpose? What makes you get out of bed in the morning? Is today a day to set goals? What would make you happy today? How about sorting that long-delayed meet-up with your bezzie, or if you’re feeling adventurous, a random act of kindness? Put a smile on someone’s face and feel the love.`,
  `I don’t know how my story will end, but nowhere in my text will it read "I gave up".`,
  `We spend too many hours of our lives worrying about minutiae. Will we even remember in two weeks’ time what we’ve laid awake worrying about last night? If you can do something about the issue that’s worrying you, then do it, if you can’t, get to the gym, go for a walk, meet a friend, but don’t waste valuable time on something you can’t change.`,
  `5x5 rule, if it’s not going to matter in 5 years, don’t spend more than 5 minutes being upset by it.`,
